adventurePlanner
============

I am seeking new spots around me to explore. I want to do my exploring in the best possible weather. This project helps me (and hopefully you) find these cool new spots. I have found it is great for hikes, beaches and dog parks. Check it out [here!](http://nathansass.github.io/adventurePlanner/#/landing)


## Development

To start developing in the project run:

```bash
gulp serve
```

## Production ready build - a.k.a. dist

To make the app ready for deploy to production run:

```bash
gulp dist
```

Now there's a `./dist` folder with all scripts and stylesheets concatenated and minified, also third party libraries installed with bower will be concatenated and minified into `vendors.min.js` and `vendors.min.css` respectively.
